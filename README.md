## :rocket: About Me!

My name is Aldo Ibuado and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer :desktop_computer:. I have a B.S. degree in Psychology from Union College of Lincoln, NE and I also have a certificaiton for Full-Stack Web Development from URC Extension from Riverside, CA. I enjoy helping others, figuring things out, pushing myself to excel. Web development has always been fascinating to me because of the fact that you are able to get creative, work with a team and make client's site or application come to life. I never give up, am persistent and will resrearch something until I know how to resolve a coding issue. 

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a website called The Red Place with my team. It is our project 3 that we plan to continue to work on for a local business!
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning C# to add to my list of programming langauges!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I do enojy coming up with ideas for movies, tv shows, riding dirtbikes and painting abstract art!
