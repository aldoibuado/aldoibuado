# Hi there, my name is Aldo ðŸ‘‹

## :rocket: About Me!

My name is Aldo Ibuado and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer :desktop_computer:. I have a B.S. degree in Psychology from Union College of Lincoln, NE and I also have a certificaiton for Full-Stack Web Development from URC Extension from Riverside, CA. I enjoy helping others, figuring things out, pushing myself to excel. Web development has always been fascinating to me because of the fact that you are able to get creative, work with a team and make client's site or application come to life. I never give up, am persistent and will resrearch something until I know how to resolve a coding issue.

- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning C# to add to my list of programming langauges!
